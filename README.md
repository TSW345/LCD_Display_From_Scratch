# LCD_Display_From_Scratch

This is a project that was created for my Microcontrollers course and was built over the course of the semester. There are pictures and a short video that show the design and functionality of the project. To see the full breakdown of the project, I have a link to my google drive that hosts a 2 minute video showing a full but concise explanation of how the project works.
